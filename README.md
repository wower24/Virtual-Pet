# Virtual-Pet
A game project (for Computer Programming Class).

“Virtual Pet” is a game like Tamagotchi. It is a single-player game, all you have to do is click on buttons.</br>
There is a dog the player has to feed, play with and put to sleep to keep it alive. </br>
The player can also train abilities of their pet (speed, jump, obedience) in order to take part in competitions (and  to earn money for food). </br>
There are several actions the player can take with the dog: </br>
-> eat, sleep, play (satisfy needs) </br>
-> train, compete (increase levels of abilities) </br>
Each of actions affect needs in their own way. </br></br>

On the left we have actions to take with a dog. At the top there’s dog’s name and it’s age. On the right we see number of ability points (AP) and speed, jump, and obedience level that we can raise by clicking “ADD” buttons next to them.
At the bottom we can see need bars of our dog, based on that we can tell if it’s hungry, bored, or sleepy.
To feed the dog if you don’t have food left you should go to the shop and buy some by clicking on a bone image. You can exit the shop by pressing “Escape”.
Then when you click the “FEED” button, the bone will appear next to it.
You have to drag the bone and drop it at the dog. Then, confirm it with “Enter”. </br></br>

To play with the dog click “PLAY” button and move the ball (the orange circle) somewhere on the map. Then you will see an animation of dog walking towards the ball.</br></br>

To put a dog to sleep click “SLEEP” button. To restore all the sleep points it takes 10 seconds of waiting per point.
To do some training click “TRAIN” button. This will take 5 seconds and give you 5 ability points. </br></br>

To compete click “COMPETE” button. It will give you money. The better your dog is with his abilities, the more money you will get. </br>
You can also move the dog by pressing arrows:</br>
“UP” – stand up</br>
“DOWN” – sit</br>
“LEFT” – move from right to left/walk to the left</br>
“RIGHT” – move from left to right/walk to the right</br></br>

To exit just press a red “X”. The data will be saved automatically.</br>
